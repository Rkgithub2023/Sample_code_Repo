shares</td>
<td>The necessity for valuation of shares arises inter alia in the
following circumstances :
i) Purchase of a book of shares which may or may not give the
holder thereof a controlling interest in the company.
ii) Purchase of shares by employees of the company where the
retention of such shares is limited to the period of their
employment
iii) Formulation of schemes of amalgamation, absorption, etc
iv) Acquisition of interest of dissenting shareholders under a
scheme of reconstruction
v) Compensating shareholders on the acquisition of their shares
by the Government under a scheme of rationalization
vi) Conversion of shares, say, conversion of preference shares
into equity
vii) Advancing a loan on the security of shares</td>

depending upon circumstances :
i) Break-up value method (or liquidation value method)
ii) Appraised value method; and
iii) Book value method
Depending on the circumstances of the case, goodwill may or may
not be included. Goodwill comes in for distinct consideration only
when the number of shares involved is large giving to the holder a
measure of control. Normally, earning represents the result of
application of all assets of every description in the business,
whether it is plant and machinery or goodwill or patent or know-
how, for a small number of shares in a going concern, earning is
the only appropriate basis.</td>

expense when it is incurred unless :
a) It forms part of the cost of an intangible asset that meets the
recognition criteria
b) The item is acquired in an amalgamation in the nature of
purchase and cannot be recognized as an intangible asset
If this is the case, this expenditure (included in the cost of
acquisition) should form part of the amount attributed to goodwill
(capital reserve) at the date of acquisition.
In some cases, expenditure is incurred to provide future economic
benefits to an enterprise, but no intangible asset or other asset is
acquired or created that can be recognized as an expense when it
is incurred. For example, expenditure on research is always
recognized as an expense when it is incurred. Examples of other
expenditure that its recognized as an expense when it is incurred
include :
a) Expenditure on start up activities (start up costs), unless this
expenditure is included in the cost of an item of fixed asset.
Start up costs may consist of preliminary expenses incurred in
establishing a legal entity
b) Expenditure on training activities
c) Expenditure on advertising and promotional activities; and

Review of
amortization period
and amortization
method</td>
<td>- The depreciable amount of an intangible asset should
be allocated on a systematic basis over the best
estimate of its useful life.
- There is a rebuttable presumption that the useful life of
an intangible asset will not exceed ten years from the
date when the asset is available for use.
- Amortization should commence when the asset is
available for use
- As the future economic benefits embodied in an
intangible asset are consumed over time, the carrying
amount of the asset is reduced to reflect that
consumption.
- This is achieved by systematic allocation of the cost of
the asset, less any residual value, as an expense over
the asset’s useful life. Amortization is recognized
whether or not there has been an increase in, for
example, the asset’s fair value or recoverable amount.
- Given the history of rapid changes in technology,
computer software and many other intangible assets
are susceptible to technological obsolescence
- Therefore, it is likely that their useful life will be short
- If control over the future economic benefits from an
intangible asset is achieved through legal rights that
have been granted for a finite period, the useful life of
the intangible asset should not exceed the period of the
legal rights unless the legal rights are renewable and
renewal is virtually certain.
- The amortization period should be reviewed at least at
each financial year end
- If the expected useful life of the asset is significantly
different from previous estimates, the amortization
period should be changed accordingly.</td>
